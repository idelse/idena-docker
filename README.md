# Quick reference
Idena is the first humanistic blockchain. In Bitcoin one core is one vote, in Tezos one XTZ is one vote, in Idena one human is one vote. How Idena achieves One-Human-One-Vote? This is achieved through conducting synchronous global Turing test Validation parties at sharp 13:30 UTC each validation day.
